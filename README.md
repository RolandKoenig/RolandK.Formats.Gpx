### Common Information
A .NET Standard for reading and writing GPX (GPS Exchange Format) files.
This library was build for my [GpxViewer](https://github.com/RolandKoenig/GpxViewer) project. It is based
on the System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer class and therefore available for .NET Framework and .NET Core projects.

### Feature overview
 - Full document model for gpx files
 - Load gpx files
 - Write gpx files
 - Add custom metadata to gpx files
 - Don't lose other custom metadate after loading and saving gpx files
